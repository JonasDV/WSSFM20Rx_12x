# Getting started with Wisol SFM20Rx EVK SDK

## Introduction

The purpose of this tutorial is to help you getting started with Wisol quad-mode module SFM20Rx

__SFM20Rx__ is a multi-mode module including __Sigfox__ connectivity, __WiFi__, __BLE__ and __GPS__ and multiple sensors (magnetic, temperature, accelerometer). The EVK also comes with an NFC tag.
The main core of the module is based on the Nordic nRF52832 SOC. Wisol has developed an application layer on top of Nordic SDK to interact with all connectivity blocks and sensors. BLE can be directly programmed using Nordic SDK directives as it is embedded into the nRF52 chip.
